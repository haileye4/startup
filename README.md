# **Elevator Pitch**

Imagine a game with multiple possibilities. You and your friends play the same game, but end up with completely different results. My application is a choose your own adventure game, in the wilds of the Amazon Jungle. "Jungle Mania" is a game where your choices determine your destiny. A prompt will appear, with two choices you can take. You login, play the game, and can compare your results with friends.

# Amazon web services
My IP Address is **http://52.14.201.106**

The command to remote shell is ➜  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
*example*: ➜  ssh -i ~/keys/production.pem ubuntu@53.104.2.123

## What I have learned from my Simon html:
I learned more in-depth about paragraphs, divisions, body and headers, and the href argument to include hyperlinks to other html files. This is all completely new to me since I have never worked in html before. I also thought the table sections all starting with t were really interesting, and helpful in organizing the different information stored.

To deploy files from terminal into my website, do 
./deployFiles.sh -k "C:\Users\haile\CS260\happy.pem" -h startup.haileyjohnson.click -s startup

To deplot files for Simon:
./deployFiles.sh -k "C:\Users\haile\CS260\happy.pem" -h simon.haileyjohnson.click -s simon
