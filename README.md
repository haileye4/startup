Hello! These are my first changes from VS Code!!

Here are my second changes made FROM GitHub

Here is my merge *conflict* in github haha

Here is my merge *conflict* in VSCode!

**Final Note**: This assignment definitely helped me understand commit versus push and pull. I was very confused when I started, but now after going to the TA lab too and working through I understand much better how VSCode and GitHub works.
