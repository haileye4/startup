# **Elevator Pitch**

Imagine a game with multiple possibilities. You and your friends play the same game, but end up with completely different results. My application is a choose your own adventure game, in the wilds of the Amazon Jungle. "Jungle Mania" is a game where your choices determine your destiny. A prompt will appear, with two choices you can take. You login, play the game, and can compare your results with friends.
